Acknowledgments
---------------

If MELT significantly contributed to your work, consider adding to acknowledgments:

   "We thank Chengzheng Yong for developing the Molecular Emission Line
   Tool (MELT), which facilitated our spectroscopic analysis."

Usage in Publications
---------------------

Journal Articles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**In methods section**:

   "Emission line wavelengths were identified using the Molecular Emission
   Line Tool (MELT) [1], an interactive web-based database. The tool searches
   spectroscopic data compiled from Pearse & Gaydon [2] using element and
   wavelength range filters."

**In figure captions**:

   "Figure 2: Synthetic spectrum generated using MELT with FWHM = 0.5 nm,
   showing expected Câ‚‚ Swan band emission around 516 nm."

**In data availability**:

   "Spectroscopic reference data is available through the Molecular Emission
   Line Tool at https://copland-yz.github.io/MELT/"

Conference Presentations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**On slides**:

   Data source: Molecular Emission Line Tool (MELT)
   https://copland-yz.github.io/MELT/

**In acknowledgments slide**:

   - Molecular Emission Line Tool (MELT) - Chengzheng Yong

Theses and Dissertations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**In methods chapter**:

   "The Molecular Emission Line Tool (MELT) [1] was used to identify potential
   emission lines in the wavelength range of interest. MELT provides an
   interactive interface for searching molecular spectroscopic data from
   authoritative sources including Pearse & Gaydon [2]. The tool allows
   filtering by element composition and wavelength range, and can generate
   synthetic spectra to compare with experimental observations."
