# Molecular Emission Line Tool (MELT)

An interactive web-based search tool for molecular emission lines. 

ðŸ”— **Live Tool**: [https://copland-yz.github.io/MELT/](https://copland-yz.github.io/MELT/)

## Core Features

- **Search emission lines by filtering elements and range parameters**
- **Spectrum Visualization**: Generate example spectra from selected emission lines
- **Downloadable Contents**: Can download the search results and the example spectrum

## Usage Examples

### ðŸ”¬Laboratory Spectroscopy

- Search for the source of emission lines for **LIBS (laser induced breakdown spectroscopy), plasma science, or other analytical chemistry** research 
- Find reference lines for wavelength calibration
- Generate example spectra to understand a group of lines and instrumental resolution effects

### ðŸ’»Workflow

1. **Search for lines**: Use element (click once to include, click twice to exclude) and data range (nanometers, Ã…ngstrÃ¶m, micrometer, GHz, or wavenumber) filters to find relevant emission lines (a small range <100 nm is recommended)
2. **Select lines**: Check the boxes next to lines of interest in the results table
3. **Adjust parameters**: Set the peak width to simulate instrumental resolution
4. **Generate spectrum**: Click "Generate Spectrum" to create an interactive visualization
5. **Export**: Download the spectrum as PNG or the selected lines as TXT/CSV

## Technical Details

### Implementation

- **Frontend**: Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript with Chart.js for visualization
- **Database**: JSON files loaded dynamically via fetch API  
- **Parsing**: Regex-based molecular formula parsing for element extraction
- **Spectrum Generation**: Gaussian peak modeling with user-adjustable FWHM
- **Export**: Canvas-based PNG export and client-side file generation

## Development

### Deploy the website locally

1. Make sure you have installed the requirements (ruby-dev, bundler, and nodejs)
   
   For Linux (or Windows Subsystem for Linux) the command is:
   
   ```shell
   sudo apt install ruby-dev ruby-bundler nodejs
   ```
   
   If you see errorÂ `Unable to locate package ruby-bundler`,Â `Unable to locate package nodejs` , run the following:
   
   ```shell
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
   ```
   
   then try runÂ `sudo apt install ruby-dev ruby-bundler nodejs`Â again.
   
   On MacOS the command is:
   
   ```shell
   brew install ruby
   brew install node
   gem install bundler
   ```

2. RunÂ `bundle install`Â to install ruby dependencies. If you get errors, delete Gemfile.lock and try again.
   
   If you see file permission error likeÂ `Fetching bundler-2.6.3.gem ERROR: While executing gem (Gem::FilePermissionError) You don't have write permissions for the /var/lib/gems/3.2.0 directory.`Â orÂ `Bundler::PermissionError: There was an error while trying to write to /usr/local/bin.`Â Install Gems Locally (Recommended):
   
   ```shell
   bundle config set --local path 'vendor/bundle'
   ```
   
   then try runÂ `bundle install`Â again. If succeeded, you should see a folder calledÂ `vendor`Â andÂ `.bundle`.

3. Run:
   
   ```shell
   bundle exec jekyll serve -l -H localhost
   ```
   
   to generate the HTML and serve it fromÂ `localhost:4000/molecular-emission-lines`Â the local server will automatically rebuild and refresh the pages on change.
   
   Note: Sometimes the page will not be automatically rebuild. In this circumstance, use `Ctrl+C` to stop it, and run the building command again.

### Adding New Databases

1. Convert spectroscopic data to JSON format with required fields:
   
   ```json
       {
           "molecule": "CO",
           "system": "THE TRIPLET BANDS, dÂ³Î”â€“aÂ³Î ",
           "wavelength_nm": 646.46,
           "wavelength_angstrom": 6464.6,
           "upper_level": "dÂ³Î”",
           "lower_level": "aÂ³Î ",
           "intensity": null,
           "source": "Pearse & Gaydon (1976) p.111",
           "page": 111
       }
   ```

2. Add JSON files to `assets/data/` directory

3. Update `molecular-lines.js` to include new file paths in loading logic
