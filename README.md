# Molecular Emission Lines Tool

An interactive web-based search tool for molecular emission lines. This tool provides access to the comprehensive Pearse & Gaydon molecular spectroscopy database.

ðŸ”— **Live Tool**: [https://copland-yz.github.io/molecular-emission-lines/](https://copland-yz.github.io/molecular-emission-lines/)

## Features

- **Interactive Periodic Table**: Click elements to include/exclude them from search results
- **Multi-Parameter Search**: Filter by wavelength and frequency ranges
- **Spectrum Visualization**: Generate realistic example spectra from selected emission lines
- **Downloadable Results**: Export search results as TXT or CSV files
- **Downloadable Spectra**: Save generated spectra as PNG images
- **Comprehensive Database**: Extensive collection of molecular emission lines from the authoritative Pearse & Gaydon reference

## Database Source

### Pearse & Gaydon Collection

- **Source**: "The Identification of Molecular Spectra" by R.W.B. Pearse and A.G. Gaydon (1976)
- **Publisher**: Chapman and Hall
- **Coverage**: ~270 pages of molecular emission line data
- **Content**: The most comprehensive and authoritative reference for molecular spectroscopy, widely used by astronomers and laboratory spectroscopists worldwide

## Search Capabilities

### Element Filtering

- **Include Mode** (Green): Show only molecules containing selected elements
- **Exclude Mode** (Red): Hide molecules containing selected elements  
- **Combined Logic**: Use both modes for precise molecular selection

### Parameter Ranges

- **Wavelength**: Search by wavelength range in nanometers
- **Frequency**: Search by frequency range in GHz
- **Smart Display**: Only shows relevant columns (wavelength OR frequency) when filtering

## Usage Examples

### ðŸš€Astronomical Applications

- Search for CO emission lines: Select Carbon and Oxygen elements
- Find lines in specific wavelength windows for telescope observations
- Exclude atmospheric interferers by filtering out H2O, O2, N2

### ðŸ”¬Laboratory Spectroscopy

- Search for the source of emission lines in LIBS (laser induced breakdown spectroscopy) research
- Find reference lines for wavelength calibration
- Generate example spectra to understand line blending and instrumental resolution effects

### Spectrum Generation Workflow

1. **Search for lines**: Use element and wavelength filters to find relevant emission lines
2. **Select lines**: Check the boxes next to lines of interest in the results table
3. **Adjust parameters**: Set the peak width (0.1-5.0 nm) to simulate instrumental resolution
4. **Generate spectrum**: Click "Generate Spectrum" to create an interactive visualization
5. **Export**: Download the spectrum as PNG or the selected lines as TXT/CSV

## Technical Details

### Implementation

- **Frontend**: Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript with Chart.js for visualization
- **Database**: JSON files loaded dynamically via fetch API  
- **Parsing**: Regex-based molecular formula parsing for element extraction
- **Performance**: Client-side filtering for fast interactive search
- **Spectrum Generation**: Gaussian peak modeling with user-adjustable FWHM
- **Export**: Canvas-based PNG export and client-side file generation

## Development

### Adding New Databases

1. Convert spectroscopic data to JSON format with required fields:
   
   ```json
       {
           "molecule": "CO",
           "system": "THE TRIPLET BANDS, dÂ³Î”â€“aÂ³Î ",
           "wavelength_nm": 646.46,
           "wavelength_angstrom": 6464.6,
           "upper_level": "dÂ³Î”",
           "lower_level": "aÂ³Î ",
           "transition_type": "allowed",
           "intensity": null,
           "source": "Pearse & Gaydon (1976) p.111",
           "page": 111
       }
   ```

2. Add JSON files to `assets/data/` directory

3. Update `molecular-lines.js` to include new file paths in loading logic
